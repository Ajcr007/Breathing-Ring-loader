# Breathing-Ring-loader
This breathing ring is a simple yet elegant design made with HTML and CSS. It consists of a circle with a breathing effect, which simulates the rhythm of a deep breath. The animation creates an illusion of the ring expanding and contracting, which makes it look like it's breathing.
